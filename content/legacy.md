## Legacy Features

Keeping back-compatibility is one of the main tenets of Babylon.js. However, with changes in technology, we sometimes have to make the decision to move older features to "Legacy" status, so that we can develop more modern and efficient approaches to problems. When a legacy feature has a more modern approach, it is advised to move to the modern approach when possible. This section lists all of our legacy features.
