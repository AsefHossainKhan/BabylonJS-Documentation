## What to Expect
This page is a breakdown of each node available in the Node Geometry Editor. The nodes will be listed in the same order by group as they are in the tool's node list. The reason for this order is that there may be some generalities that apply to all nodes in a group and those will be listed once rather than repeating them for each node. For each node we will discuss all inputs, outputs, properties, and considerations to ensure all requirements for using a node are highlighed. 

## Sources
Source nodes are a requirement for any Node Geometry graph as they supply the Geometry that is needed by the `GeometryOutput` node for the graph to be able to build. Most of these nodes will come with multiple inputs that will set the basic properties of the Geometry, but all have exactly one output which is Geometry generated by the source node. 

Each parameter that can be set for the source Geometry can either be set by connecting a node or nodes to set a specific value or it can be set in the properties of the node. If a parameter's port on the node is connected by a wire, the parameter is removed from the parameter list on the node as it is deriving its value from the connected node(s). 

If there is a set of connected properties - such as size, width, height, and depth - the more specific properties take precedence over the more general properties. In other words, if values are passed to size AND width then the parameter passed to width will apply to the width of the Geometry and height and depth will take their values from size. In this way, it is normal to see values wired to both general and specific properties at the same time. If, however, there are values passed to size, width, height, and depth then the value passed to size is not used at all and is not needed.

## Inputs
Input nodes consist of basic value types used to set properties on other nodes. There are a few common properties on all input nodes. Those consist of the following.

- **Mode** allows the input to be defined as a user-defined value or a contextual value of any type. User-defined values are just as they seem, the user assigned a constant value to the node. A contextual value is derived from the closest geometry node associated with this node. Changing mode to a different value can also change the type of data the node represents. For example, a Float input can be changed to a Vector2 contextual value which will change the data type supplied by the node. Be aware of this when changing mode as it can affect connections to other nodes. Note that if mode is set to a contextual value, the node will no longer display *Visible on frame*, *Min*, *Max*, or *Value* in the node properties but will instead display *Contextual value*.
- **Contextual value** assigns the source of the data for any input set to a contextual value. The sources available depend on the data type selected for the input node. For example, choosing a Vector2 contextual value allows access to vertex IDs and choosing a Vector3 contextual value would offer vertex positions.
- **Visible on frame** is a boolean which allows any input contained within a frame to be visible in the INPUTS list of the properties panel for a frame. Simply enable the boolean and then whenever a frame is selected - expanded or collapsed - any visible input can have its value changed directly in the frame properties panel.

## Contextual
Contextual nodes consist of values derived from the closest source associated with a contextual node in the graph. The way to determine what source is referenced by a contextual value is to trace wires from the contextual value node until finding a node that has a reference that could supply the context. For contextual nodes that reference geometric values like position or normal, trace wires to the first node that references geometry, and this will be the source that is being referenced.

![Tracing contextual values to their source geometry](/img/tools/nge/tracingContext.jpg)

In addition to geometric contextual values, there are other types of contextual values. One of them being LoopID which is a contextual value for the iteration of a node that loops. In this case, tracing wires to the first node that is iterable would be the source for the contextual value.  

![Tracing non-geometric contextual values to their source](/img/tools/nge/tracingContext2.jpg)

To help in identifying what source is feeding a contextual value, the graph will highlight the node providing the source of the contextual value when selecting any contextual value as can be seen in the images above. The playground below can be used to experiment with contextual values and better understand how they reference their source.

<Playground id="#90J8BM#2" title="contextual values" description="Using contextual values to drive mesh creation." image="/img/playgroundsAndNMEs/contextualValuesPG.jpg"/>

Contextual nodes are typically an array of values determined by the components of the source such as the vertices of referenced geometry or There are a couple of common properties on all input nodes. Those consist of the following.

- **Mode** allows the node to be defined as a user-defined value or a contextual value of any type. User-defined values are just as they seem, the user assigned a constant value to the node. A contextual value is derived from the closest geometry node associated with this node. Changing mode to a different value can also change the type of data the node represents. For example, a CollectionID contextual node can be updated to a Vector2 contextual value which will change the data type supplied by the node. Be aware of this when changing mode as it can affect connections to other nodes. Note that if mode is changed to user-defined, the node will no longer display *Contextual value* but will instead show *Visible on frame*, *Min*, *Max*, and *Value* in the node properties.
- **Contextual value** assigns the source of the data for any input set to a contextual value. The sources available depend on the data type selected for the input node. For example, choosing a Vector2 contextual value allows access to vertex IDs and choosing a Vector3 contextual value would offer vertex positions.

## Logical
Logical nodes are used to branch a node graph by performing a test between two Float values. If the test between the two values meets the condition set by the node, a value of true is returned and the nodes connected to the ifTrue port are passed to the output. Otherwise, the nodes connected to the ifFalse port are passed to the output. There are common properties that are possessed by all logical nodes and are as follows.

- **right** is an input field to be able to set a Float value for the right port manually. This is a shortcut to help reduce complexity on the graph if the test needs to be done against a constant value. 
- **Test** sets the condition for the comparison between the two values connected to the node. Any logical can be easily changed to another logical node simply by changing the Test parameter without needing to replace the node with a different logical node.
- **ifTrue and ifFalse** ports on each logical node do not need to be connected to anything for the node to function. If a node is connected to ifTrue or ifFalse, that node will be passed when appropriate condition is met. If nothing is connected to ifTrue or ifFalse, the node will output 1.0 and 0.0 respectively. This allows for successive logical tests by testing if the previous logical test was true (1.0) or false (0.0) without the need to wire Float nodes for ifTrue and ifFalse in the graph.

The required input for this node is the geometry input and the output will also be geometry. The rest of the inputs are optional, but if providing a Matrix input to the node, the translation, rotation, and scale inputs will be ignored as the Matrix takes precedence over the individual transform inputs. 

#### Properties
- **translation** is an input field for a Vectror3 value to be used to translate the position of the geometry. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the translation input.
- **rotation** is an input field for a Vectror3 value in radians to be used to set the rotation of the geometry. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **scaling** is an input field for a Vectror3 value to be used to set the scale of the geometry. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** is used for optimization in the graph when using successive iterable nodes. If this property is set to true, each iteration in this node will also calculate all looped context feeding this node. If there are several iterable nodes connected in sequence, the calculations become exponential with every iteration of the current node calculating every iteration of the previous node back to the beginning of the chain. This can cause a spike in process time in the graph. Disabling evaluate context will prevent nodes from initiating evaluations of previous context each iteration which will greatly speed up the graph. However, since there may be a case where it is desireable to re-evaluate context with each iteration of a node, this parameter is available to the user and defaults to true. If a graph seems to be taking too long to process, check iterable nodes to see if disabling the evaluation of context will help improve performance.

![Vector converter node](/img/tools/nge/converterNode.jpg)

### VectorConverter
This node is used to either split a vector into its components or assemble components into a vector. This node has a lot of utility for introducing a change into one or more components of a vector based on the need of the user. It can also be used to swizzle components or assemble components in several ways to make up a vector. Each input will override the narrower inputs below it. For example, a Vector4 connected to the xyzw input will override any values connected to xyz, xy, zw, x, y, z, or w. The process is the same for each input so any value connected to the xy input will override any values connected to the x and y inputs. 

The values provided by the outputs depend entirely on the values connected to the inputs. The node will work from the top input down and assemble a Vector4 value which can then be referenced from any of the outputs. If there is a component of the Vector4 output that was not defined in the input, the value of that component will be 0.0. This means if you only connect values to the x, y, and z inputs there will still be a Vector4 value available in the xyzw output that has 0.0 for the value of w. Since the inputs work from the top down, the VectorConverter will work with various combinations. For example, connecting values to the xy input as well as the z and w inputs will create a complete Vector4 value with no overrides. However, if connecting values to the xyz input as well as the z and w inputs will create a Vector4 of the xyz input and the w input, ignoring the value connected to the z input. 

#### Inputs
- **xyzw** is connected to a Vector4 value which overrides duplicate channel values lower on the node.
- **xyz** is connected to a Vector3 value which overrides duplicate channel values lower on the node.
- **xy** is connected to a Vector2 value which overrides duplicate channel values lower on the node.
- **zw** is connected to a Vector2 value which overrides duplicate channel values lower on the node.
- **x** is connected to a Float value.
- **y** is connected to a Float value.
- **z** is connected to a Float value.
- **w** is connected to a Float value.

#### Outputs
- **xyzw** returns a Vector4 value made from the input components, assigning 0.0 to any channel not defined by the inputs.
- **xyz** returns a Vector3 value made from the input components, assigning 0.0 to any channel not defined by the inputs.
- **xy** returns a Vector2 value made from the input components, assigning 0.0 to any channel not defined by the inputs.
- **zw** returns a Vector2 value made from the input components, assigning 0.0 to any channel not defined by the inputs.
- **x** returns a Float value for the x component supplied by the inputs or 0.0 if the channel was not defined by the inputs.
- **y** returns a Float value for the y component supplied by the inputs or 0.0 if the channel was not defined by the inputs.
- **z** returns a Float value for the z component supplied by the inputs or 0.0 if the channel was not defined by the inputs.
- **w** returns a Float value for the w component supplied by the inputs or 0.0 if the channel was not defined by the inputs.

## Matrices
These nodes are used to create transformation matrices to transform geometry in a variety of ways. Depending on the node, the inputs expect either Float or Vector3 types but the output for all of these nodes is type Matrix.

- **translation** is connected to a node providing a Vector3 value to generate the Matrix.

#### Outputs
- **matrix** is the transformation Matrix that can be applied to a Transform node attached to geometry. 

## Instances
These nodes are used to create instances of input geometry in one of several different methods. In all cases, multiple instances of a specific geometry are created but the differences come in where they are instantiated and how many instances are created. Several of these nodes use a separate piece of geometry to drive position and location for instances, but this can also be done by setting positions and count manually. Each node in this set, however, outputs a single geometry regardless of if a helper geometry is used to generate positions and number of instances. Additionally, these nodes generate a single geometry rather than individual instances, so there is no need to merge them after these nodes.

![Instantiate node](/img/tools/nge/instantiateNode.jpg)

### Instantiate

This node generates instances of geometry wired to an input based on the count input. These instances will be output as a single geometry rather than multiple instanced meshes. The transform of each instance is taken from the matrix input which will override the inputs below it OR is taken from the inputs for position, rotation, and scaling. Like the Vector Converter node, if the matrix input is connected then position, rotation, and scaling are ignored as the matrix input will account for the entire transformation of the instance.

#### Properties
- **count** is an input field for an Int value to be used to determine the number of instances to create. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the count input.
- **translation** is an input field for a Vectror3 value to be used to translate the position of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the translation input.
- **rotation** is an input field for a Vectror3 value in radians to be used to set the rotation of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **scaling** is an input field for a Vectror3 value to be used to set the scale of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** is used for optimization in the graph when using successive iterable nodes. If this property is set to true, each iteration in this node will also calculate all looped context feeding this node. If there are several iterable nodes connected in sequence, the calculations become exponential with every iteration of the current node calculating every iteration of the previous node back to the beginning of the chain. This can cause a spike in process time in the graph. Disabling evaluate context will prevent nodes from initiating evaluations of previous context each iteration which will greatly speed up the graph. However, since there may be a case where it is desireable to re-evaluate context with each iteration of a node, this parameter is available to the user and defaults to true. If a graph seems to be taking too long to process, check iterable nodes to see if disabling the evaluation of context will help improve performance.

#### Inputs

![Instantiate on faces node](/img/tools/nge/instantiateOnFacesNode.jpg)

### InstantiateOnFaces

This node generates instances of the geometry wired to the instance input on this node. These instances will be output as a single geometry rather than multiple instanced meshes. The instance positions are driven by a source geometry connected to the geometry input. Each instance will be distributed across the available faces of the source mesh. The position of each mesh will be a randomly generated position coplanar with and within the bounds of the target face. If there are fewer instances than faces on the source geometry, not every face will be assigned an instance. However, if there are more instances than faces in the source mesh, each face in the source mesh will be assigned one or more instances. If there is a connection made to the matrix input of this node, the transformation of each instance will be driven from this input. Any connections made to the matrix input will override any connections made to the inputs below it. If nothing is connected to the matrix input, the transformation is taken from any connections to inputs for position, rotation, and scaling.

#### Properties
- **count** is an input field for an Int value to be used to determine the number of instances to create. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the count input.
- **rotation** is an input field for a Vectror3 value in radians to be used to set the rotation of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **scaling** is an input field for a Vectror3 value to be used to set the scale of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** is used for optimization in the graph when using successive iterable nodes. If this property is set to true, each iteration in this node will also calculate all looped context feeding this node. If there are several iterable nodes connected in sequence, the calculations become exponential with every iteration of the current node calculating every iteration of the previous node back to the beginning of the chain. This can cause a spike in process time in the graph. Disabling evaluate context will prevent nodes from initiating evaluations of previous context each iteration which will greatly speed up the graph.

If a graph seems to be taking too long to process, check iterable nodes to see if disabling the evaluation of context will help improve performance.

![Instantiate on vertices node](/img/tools/nge/instantiateOnVerticesNode.jpg)

### InstantiateOnVertices

This node generates instances of the geometry wired to the instance input on this node. These instances will be output as a single geometry rather than multiple instanced meshes. The instance positions are driven by a source geometry connected to the geometry input. The number of instances created will be determined by the vertex count of the source geometry and the density input value using a 0.0 - 1.0 range. Density defines the percentage of randomly selected vertices that will have an instance created at its position and each will receive exactly one instance. If there is a connection made to the matrix input of this node, the transformation of each instance will be driven from this input. Any connections made to the matrix input will override any connections made to the inputs below it. If nothing is connected to the matrix input, the transformation is taken from any connections to inputs for position, rotation, and scaling.

#### Properties
- **density** is an input field for a float value with a range of 0.0 - 1.0 which determines the percentage of randomly selected vertices that are eligible to for an instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the count input.
- **rotation** is an input field for a Vectror3 value in radians to be used to set the rotation of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **scaling** is an input field for a Vectror3 value to be used to set the scale of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** is used for optimization in the graph when using successive iterable nodes. If this property is set to true, each iteration in this node will also calculate all looped context feeding this node.

- **Remove duplicate positions** is used to prevent instances from being assigned to vertices that share the same position with another vertex in the source geometry.

#### Inputs

- **density** is connected to a node providing an Float value in a range of 0.0 - 1.0 which determines the percentage of randomly selected vertices that are eligible for an instance.

![Instantiate on volume node](/img/tools/nge/instantiateOnVerticesNode.jpg)

### InstantiateOnVolume

This node generates instances of the geometry wired to the instance input on this node. These instances will be output as a single geometry rather than multiple instanced meshes. The instance positions are driven by a source geometry connected to the geometry input. All instances created will be positioned randomly within the source mesh volume. The number of instances created will be determined by the value connected to the count input on the node. If there is a connection made to the matrix input of this node, the transformation of each instance will be driven from this input. Any connections made to the matrix input will override any connections made to the inputs below it. If nothing is connected to the matrix input, the transformation is taken from any connections to inputs for position, rotation, and scaling.

Note that this node needs to make several ray casts to ensure all instances fall witin the volume of the source mesh so this node can be quite slow. Keeping the source mesh simple and the number of instances few will help optimize the time this node requires, but expect this node to be resource instensive whenever it is used.  

#### Properties
- **count** is an input field for an Int value to be used to determine the number of instances to create. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the count input.
- **rotation** is an input field for a Vectror3 value in radians to be used to set the rotation of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the rotation input.
- **scaling** is an input field for a Vectror3 value to be used to set the scale of each instance. This property is only visible if there is no wire connected to the scaling input.

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** is used for optimization in the graph when using successive iterable nodes. If this property is set to true, each iteration in this node will also calculate all looped context feeding this node. If there are several iterable nodes connected in sequence, the calculations become exponential with every iteration of the current node calculating every iteration of the previous node back to the beginning of the chain.

## Misc
These nodes are largely to help with organization and debugging a graph, but there is also some ulility to be found in them. Node graphs are notorious for being difficult to read once they get complex due to the spaghetti of wires that often occurs within large graphs. That's where both the teleport nodes and the elbow node come in. These nodes help reduce some of the wire complexity in graphs, making them much easier to read. Debugging the graph can also be challenging especially when large arrays of values are being pushed through the graph. The debug node is crucial for being able to see values passed along any wire at any point. Lastly, the GeometryInfo node can be used as easily to debug the graph as it can to drive logic within.

![Debug node](/img/tools/nge/debugNode.jpg)

### Debug
The debug node is a very simple node that can be connected to Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, and Matrix types. While the node can be manually connected between two nodes, simply dropping a debug from the graph on an existing wire of a supported type will automatically connect the node in the middle of the existing wire. Alternatively a debug node can be inserted into an existing wire simply by holding crtl and left clicking any compatible wire. And while these methods of quickly inserting a debug node require it to be inserted between two nodes, the debug node does not require a connection to its output to function. It can be a terminal node in the graph if needed to debug a value that isn't easily connected back to the graph flow.

The node doesn't do any calculations in the graph, only displays the values carried along the wire in the properties panel. Simply select the node and the panel will display whatever value is being passed. This also works for iterable nodes that may contain an array of values. Since the debug node is only used to display information in the UI, there is no cost to the node and debug nodes can be left within a graph much like an elbow node if desired.

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing a Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, or Matrix type.

#### Outputs
- **output** is a passthrough of the value connected to input of the same type. Note that the debug node only works if it is connected to a path that reaches the GeometryOutput node. If the output does not connect to GeometryOutput at some point, this node won't be evaluated and will not show any debug values when selected.

![Elbow node](/img/tools/nge/elbowNode.jpg)

### Elbow
The elbow node is an organizational node to help route wires within a graph. It is a passthrough node that supports Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, and Geometry types. The use for this node is just to re-route wires to help with graph organization and it adds no time to the graph calculations so many can be used with no sacrifice to performance. Elbow nodes can be used sequentially as well to perform multiple bends in a wire to detour around congested areas of the graph. Like any other node, an elbow also supports multiple connections to its output port so it can be used to split one wire into many when needed.

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing a Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, or Geometry type.

#### Outputs
- **output** is a passthrough of the value connected to input of the same type.

![Geometry info node](/img/tools/nge/geometryInfoNode.jpg)

### GeometryInfo
This node is also a passthrough node for the Geometry type which adds no time to a graph. It does perform one important task which is supplying access to information about the associated geometry at this specific point of the graph. There may be need to access information like vertex count for debugging purposes which can be fed directly to a debug node. Alternatively, the collectionID of the geometry might be needed to help drive logic in the graph through nodes like equal. This node is flexible enough to fit many different needs which is why it has been added to this group.

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing a Geometry type.

#### Outputs
- **output** is a passthrough of the Geometry type connected to input.
- **id** is an Int representing the ID of the current Geometry.
- **collectionID** is an Int representing the ID assigned to this Geometry by a collection to which it is assigned.
- **verticesCount** is an Int representing the total number of vertices in this Geometry.
- **facesCount** is an Int representing the total number of faces in this Geometry.

![Teleport in node](/img/tools/nge/teleportInNode.jpg)

### TeleportIn
This node is an organizational node to help reduce the complexity of overlapping wires within a graph. It is a passthrough node that supports Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, and Geometry types. This node works in conjunction with the TeleportOut node to make a connection, often far across a graph, without the need for a wire. This node can be connected to any node to create a reference to the value passed by the connected node. When connecting the TeleportIn node to another node, it is important to rename this node to a unique name as this name will be referenced by the TeleportOut node. On the TeleportOut node, selecting the name used by this node as the entry point will create a reference to the value connected to the TeleportIn node. In this way, a single value can be used in several places of a graph without the need to stretch wires across the graph.

#### Inputs
- **input** can be connected to a node providing a Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, or Geometry type.

![Teleport out node](/img/tools/nge/teleportOutNode.jpg)

### TeleportOut
This node is an organizational node to help reduce the complexity of overlapping wires within a graph. It is a passthrough node that supports Float, Int, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix, and Geometry types. This node works in conjunction with the TeleportIn node to make a connection, often far across a graph, without the need for a wire. Setting the entry point property on this node will tell the node which value to reference. Each TeleportIn node in the graph will be available to the TeleportOut node and it can be changed just by selecting a new entry point if needed. In this way, a single value can be used in several places of a graph without the need to stretch wires across the graph.

#### Properties
- **Entry point** is the specific TeleportIn node that is referenced by this node.

#### Outputs
- **output** is the value referenced by the selected entry point in a type that matches the refernced value.

## Updates
These nodes will update connected geometry in one of several ways. It could be assigning it to a collection, merging with other geometry, or setting one of the various properties of geometry like colors, material IDs, normals, positions, tangents, or UVs. These nodes, like the math nodes, are some of the most commonly used nodes as they perform very important operations for creating geometry.

![Collection node](/img/tools/nge/collectionNode.jpg)

### Collection
This node creates a collection of up to 10 geometry inputs. When used in conjunction with one of the instantiate nodes, the collection will provide one random geometry from the collection per iteration of the instantiate node. This allows for more randomization when creating a procedural mesh. The collection also provides a unique collection ID to each included geometry to help drive logic within the graph. The collection ID can be accessed with the GeometryInfo node. 

#### Advanced
- **Evaluate context** is used for optimization in the graph when using successive iterable nodes. If this property is set to true, each iteration in this node will also calculate all looped context feeding this node. If there are several iterable nodes connected in sequence, the calculations become exponential with every iteration of the current node calculating every iteration of the previous node back to the beginning of the chain. This can cause a spike in process time in the graph. Disabling evaluate context will prevent nodes from initiating evaluations of previous context each iteration which will greatly speed up the graph. However, since there may be a case where it is desireable to re-evaluate context with each iteration of a node, this parameter is available to the user and defaults to true. If a graph seems to be taking too long to process, check iterable nodes to see if disabling the evaluation of context will help improve performance.

#### Inputs
- **geometry** is connected to a node providing a Geometry type.

![Mapping node](/img/tools/nge/mappingNode.jpg)

### Mapping
There are times when it is necessary to recompute normals when creating geometry. This node is simply there to handle any computations of normals that are needed. Simply pass the vertices to be mapped as well as the center of the projection to create UV mappings for each vertex.

#### Inputs
- **positions** is connected to the positions contextual value node to provide the vertex list to the node.
- **center** is connected to a node a Vector3 position for the center of the projection.

#### Outputs
- **uv** is the geometry after computing normals.

![Merge node](/img/tools/nge/mergeNode.jpg)

### Merge
A common operation when creating procedural geometry is to merge two or more different meshes. This node will merge up to five geometry inputs into one using a simple merge. This node does not do any type of boolean operation and does not change the vertex lists or UV coordinates at all. If multiple meshes are merged which have different material IDs, a multimaterial will be created and assigned to keep the original material breaks of each geometry.

#### Advanced

- **geometry4** can optionally be connected to a node providing a Geometry type.

#### Outputs
- **output** is the merged geometry made from those available through connectioned inputs.

![Optimize node](/img/tools/nge/optimizeNode.jpg)

### Optimize
There are times when a geometry will have unwelded vertices where mutliple vertices occupy the same position. This is common when using glTF files as the specification states that vertices that lie on a UV seam should be split for optimization reasons. If working with geometry that has unwelded vertices that need to be merged, use the optimize node. This node does a simple operation that merges any vertices that share the same position within a certain epsilon. This operation is destructive in that it creates a new triangle list and deletes all vertex parameters other than positions. This means that any mesh that has been optimized will need new normals, tangents, and vertex colors. Typically, the first node connected after an Optimize node would be a ComputeNormals node.
