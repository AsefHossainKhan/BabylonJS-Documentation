# How to use the WebVR experience helper

## WebVR vs WebXR

The WebVR Experience helper is deprecated and very limited in functionality. **It is strongly recommended that new projects use the [WebXR experience helper](/features/featuresDeepDive/webXR/webXRExperienceHelpers)**. For more information, check out our [introduction to WebXR](/features/featuresDeepDive/webXR/introToWebXR).
