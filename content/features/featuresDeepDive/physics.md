# Support for Physics Engines

Physics engines are third party external programs that can be plugged into Babylon.js. They, depending on their features, emulate "real-life" interactions between objects, which can be meshes, solid particles from the solid particle system or some cameras. One feature of a Physics Engine is the addition of gravity to a scene.

There are 2 physics architecture in Babylon.js.

- a Version 2 (V2 for short) with support for modern Physics Engines.

  > [üöÄ You can find the V2 API documented here.](/features/featuresDeepDive/physics/usingPhysicsEngine)  

- Version 1 (V1 for short), which is a pre-6.0 Legacy API.

  > [‚ö†Ô∏è The documentation for V1 has been moved to the Legacy section.](/legacy/physics)

#### We strongly recommend using V2 over V1. [A migration guide is here](/features/featuresDeepDive/physics/migrate).

## Physics V2

There are plugins for 1 physics engine:

1. Havok - a powerful engine used in AAA games.

All need to be enabled before use.

This architecture allows finer grain control on your physics scene by making the difference between collision shapes and physical body.
A typical use case is to have only one collision shape used by numerous bodies.
This allows a lower memory footprint and more efficient memory addressing.
A special effort has been put into better performance for a huge number of bodies. This is also the case for the collision callback mechanism.

A broad overview of the Physics V2 advancements is available on this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@babylonjs/physics-v2-overview-ed36039ce1e7).

## Physics V1

There are plugins for 3 physics engines:

1. Cannon.js - a wonderful physics engine written entirely in JavaScript.
2. Oimo.js - a JS port of the lightweight Oimo physics engine.
3. Ammo.js - a JS port of the bullet physics engine.

All need to be enabled before use.

Interactions between objects are achieved by imposters, simple objects that are attached to any complex objects with a scene. The imposter can be assigned physical attributes such as mass, friction, a coefficient of restitution, impulse, and linear and angular.

Two imposters can be connected using joints such as a hinge or ball and socket.

Ammo also allows the creation of soft bodies.
